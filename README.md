This is a basic GUI template for future programs. It allows the user to click and drag items on the screen and zoom in and out with the mouse wheel. A lot of the functionality is under the hood for future development. There are several classes (Bucket, Anchor, Link, etc.) that can be used to display and edit on-screen elements. Items that can be clicked and dragged also support rotation based on a specified axis point. When clicked, items can display their own options menu on the right margin.

Program runs standalone, either with run.bat (compiled and run using installed JDK software) or local_run.bat (compiled and run using ECJ322.jar- not included).

To-do list:
Better documentation of class/interface hierarchy and available functions...
